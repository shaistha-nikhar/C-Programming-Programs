Write a program to demonstrate the use of different control string and escape sequences in printf and scanf.

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
char name[50];
int age;
float height;
clrscr();
printf("Welcome to the C Programming Demo!\n");
printf("=====================================\n");
printf("Please enter your name: ");
scanf("%s", name); 
printf("Enter your age: ");
scanf("%d",&age);
printf("Enter your height in meters (e.g., 1.75): ");
scanf("%f",&height);
printf("\nHello, %s!\n", name);
printf("You are %d years old.\n", age);
printf("Your height is %.2f meters.\n", height);
printf("\nSummary:\n");
printf("=========\n");
printf("Name: %s\n", name);
printf("Age: %d\n", age);
printf("Height: %.2f meters\n", height);
printf("this is \t tab space\n");
printf("this is alert \a sound");
printf("Thank you for participating!\n");
printf("Goodbye!\n");
getch();
return 0;
}

Output:
