Write a program to perform pointer arithmetic (increment, decrement, addition, subtraction).

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
int*ptr1,*ptr2;
{
int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
int *ptr = arr;
printf("Pointer Increment:\n");
printf("Initial value of ptr: %d\n",*ptr); 
ptr++; 
printf("After incrementing, ptr points to: %d\n",*ptr);
printf("\nPointer Decrement:\n");
ptr--; 
printf("After decrementing, ptr points to: %d\n",*ptr);
printf("\nPointer Addition:\n");
ptr = arr; 
printf("Initial value of ptr: %d\n",*ptr);
ptr = ptr + 3; 
printf("After adding 3, ptr points to: %d\n",*ptr);
printf("\nPointer Subtraction:\n");
ptr = ptr - 2; 
printf("After subtracting 2, ptr points to: %d\n",*ptr); 
printf("\nPointer Subtraction between two pointers:\n");
ptr1 = arr; 
ptr2 = arr + 4; 
printf("Difference between ptr2 and ptr1: %ld\n", ptr2 - ptr1);
printf("Difference between ptr2 and ptr1: %ld\n", ptr2 - ptr1);
getch();
return 0;
}

Output:

Pointer Increment:
Initial value of ptr: 10
After incrementing, ptr points to: 20
Pointer Decrement:
After decrementing, ptr points to: 10
Pointer Addition:
Initial value of ptr: 10
After adding 3, ptr points to: 40
Pointer Subtraction:
After subtracting 2, ptr points to: 20
Pointer Subtraction between two pointers:
Difference between ptr2 and ptr1: 4
