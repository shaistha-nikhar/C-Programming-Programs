Write a program to perform basic arithmetic operations (+,-,*,/,%) and assignment, increment, and decrement operators.

#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
void main()
{
int a,b,c,d,e,f,g;
clrscr();
printf("enter the values of a and b\n");
scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
c=a+b; .
d=a-b;
e=a*b;
f=a/b;
g=a%b;
printf("The sum of two numbers is:%d\n",c);
printf("The subtraction of two numbers is:%d\n",d);
printf("The multiplication of two numbers is:%d\n",e);
printf("The division of two numbers is:%d\n",f);
printf("The modulus of two numbers is:%d\n",g);
a++;
printf(" After increment the value of a is :%d\n",a);
b--;
printf(" After decrement the value of b is :%d\n",b);
getch();
}

Output:

Enter the values of a and b
6 4
The sum of two numbers is: 10
The subtraction of two numbers is: 2
The multiplication of two numbers is: 24
The division of two numbers is: 1
The modulus of two numbers is: 2
After increment the value of a is: 7
After decrement the value of b is : 3
